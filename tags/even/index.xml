      <description>Welcome  Warning: Rant, Noob
 Just to let you know, I&amp;rsquo;m not a web designer or developer. I&amp;rsquo;m a normal (poor) electronics student who haven&amp;rsquo;t got a credit card.
To have this blog being read by someone other than myself, in my opinion, is a hard work. My goal is to host a simple website where I can write something to keep myself being motivated.
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend money on hosting, it&amp;rsquo;s not because I want everything free but because I think there is some way I can do it and I want some more food each month.</description>
